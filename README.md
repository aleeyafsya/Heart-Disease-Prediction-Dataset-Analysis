Heart disease is a serious health concern that can impact anyone, regardless of age or gender. Fortunately, many risk factors for heart disease are controllable, such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol. By utilizing statistical and machine-learning approaches, this research helps identify patterns and construct test-predictive models to better understand and prevent heart disease.

The research incorporates exploratory data analysis (EDA), which includes univariate, bivariate, and data-cleaning analyses. With the help of RStudio and R programming, data visualisation methods such as scatterplots and stacked bar charts are used to showcase data trends through the GGPLOT2 library.

This dataset research was conducted as part of the final assignment for the Data Analysis and Visualization subject, providing valuable insights and knowledge on heart disease prevention and management.
